# Wejhaty Project State

Canonical, vendor-neutral current-state snapshot. Repository code, tests,
configuration, and current Git state outrank this document when they differ.

## State metadata

- State document version: 8
- Last verified date: 2026-09-13
- Working branch: `claude/marhaba-kxry8l`
- Production implementation commit: `524fae689dfe175901f12540ddc9394fac54f626`
- The worldwide deterministic questionnaire, 194-country ranking, factual
  overview, external-card image, and crop changes are deployed and
  production-verified. User acceptance is pending.

Always recover with `git branch --show-current`, `git status --short`,
`git fetch origin`, and `git log --oneline -30`.

## Product

Wejhaty (وجهتي) is a bilingual, no-login destination discovery and
recommendation app. Arabic is the default language; English is supported. The
React/Vite frontend deploys to GitHub Pages. A separate Cloudflare Worker hosts
server-side travel-provider integrations.

## Non-negotiable product rules

- Phase 14 is the deterministic final ranking authority. Questionnaire code may
  choose which supported question to ask next but may not invent scores,
  dimensions, or weights.
- Israel (`IL`/`ISR`) is excluded from every effective catalog, routing,
  search, recommendation, image, and calculation path. Monaco (`MC`/`MCO`) is
  valid.
- Never fabricate flight prices, hotel prices, availability, inventory, or
  traveler budgets. Real provider prices and estimates must stay distinct.
- Never infer religion, ethnicity, politics, values, or cultural adaptability
  from location, nationality, language, or locale.
- Precise coordinates remain in memory only and are not sent to external
  recommendation services.
- Secrets never belong in the frontend or a `VITE_*` value.
- Preserve accepted destination and questionnaire layouts unless the user asks
  for a design change.

## Current product decision: no AI

The user rejected the AI interview and AI explanations because their questions
and results were not practical or convincing. The current local implementation
removes natural-language interpretation, AI-generated turns, AI explanations,
frontend AI/profile orchestration, Worker `/api/ai/*` routes and provider
code, the `env.AI` binding, and AI deployment variables/smoke tests.

Do not restore an AI or Hybrid interview unless the user explicitly reverses
this decision.

## Questionnaire and ranking

- Phase 14 remains the deterministic ranking authority and now scores all 194
  effective countries through a separate worldwide recommendation-profile
  layer. AI does not select questions, create fields, score, or explain.
- The questionnaire is deterministic and answer-driven. It contains 336
  bilingual conditional nodes across eight purposes. A real journey visits
  only its selected branch and resolves at most one question per canonical
  dimension (normally 12–13 questions).
- Region choices open different subregion questions and option sets. Subregion
  choices open their own contextual node; contextual options then branch to
  different useful dimensions such as climate, cost, popularity, or urbanity.
- Selecting an option advances automatically. A brief transition indicates that
  the next question is being prepared.
- After five answered questions, the traveler may show results now or continue
  answering to improve the result.
- Back remains available. Changing an earlier answer truncates stale downstream
  answers and recomputes the branch.
- Budget options retain the canonical approximate numeric SAR ranges.
- Ranking inputs use the committed World Bank indicator snapshot, existing
  World Bank price-level snapshot, UN Tourism/OWID arrivals snapshot, and
  country geography. Missing numeric observations use the worldwide median,
  with direct coverage and imputed dimensions recorded and disclosed.
- Every country has a tested ideal answer profile that places it in the top
  five for at least one purpose. A fixed 4,800-path deterministic sample also
  requires every country to appear at least once; this proves tested
  reachability, not equal appearance frequency.
- If the traveler explicitly shared location, distance breaks exact score ties
  only. It does not change match scores, and the Results page displays a note
  when the proximity tie-break is used.
- Latest full frontend verification: 534/534 tests passed in one sequential
  run. TypeScript, oxlint, the production build, AR/EN browser checks, and
  mobile overflow checks pass.

### Current recommendation limitation

All 194 countries are recommendation candidates, but the source datasets are
not complete for every indicator. Missing observations are median-imputed and
disclosed, so a match percentage is an estimate rather than a guarantee. The
4,800-path test is broad deterministic coverage, not an exhaustive enumeration
of the questionnaire's combinatorial answer space.

## Country pages and optional information

- All 194 effective countries have a factual country-information layer:
  identity, capital, region, area, currencies, languages, calling code, and
  borders where available. Countries outside the original editorial 30 now
  receive a country-specific factual overview instead of an insufficient-data
  notice.
- Planning sections for Travel, Accommodation, Travel Cost, and Tourism are
  conditionally mounted. They stay hidden on every entry path until the user
  chooses “Show additional information”.
- Hidden optional sections do not initiate dynamic provider/data work.
- The 30 original destinations retain richer editorial descriptions, cities,
  strengths, and weaknesses. Equivalent verified editorial coverage for the
  other 164 is not yet complete; their recommendation eligibility and factual
  overview must not be described as equivalent hand-written editorial content.

## Destination images

- Local coverage is 194/194 effective countries; `IL`/`ISR` is absent.
- Photos now appear on Explore and Results cards as well as destination heroes.
  Card and hero crops are audited separately; per-country object-position
  overrides correct the reviewed edge cases without replacing accepted layout.
- Every current image was visually reviewed on 2026-09-12. It depicts an
  in-country landmark, notable cityscape, nationally important site, or
  representative natural landscape.
- The old Commons free-search path allowed embassies abroad, US place-name
  homonyms, maps, documents, toys, vehicles, and random objects. The pipeline
  now starts from the human-edited Wikivoyage country article, retrieves exact
  license/attribution metadata from Wikimedia Commons, applies semantic/file/
  aspect filters, and supports reviewed exact-title overrides.
- `app/scripts/destinationImageAudit.json` records the approved source for
  every country. Tests fail if a regenerated manifest silently differs.
- Manifest: `app/src/data/generated/destinationImages.json`.
- Assets: `app/public/destinations/*.webp`.
- Status: implemented, visually reviewed, deployed, and production-verified.

## Provider and external state

- The travel-only Cloudflare Worker is deployed and production-verified. The
  production flight route preserves its CORS and validation contracts; removed
  AI routes return 404.
- Amadeus code is ready. Live offers require external
  `AMADEUS_API_KEY`/`AMADEUS_API_SECRET` provisioning.
- Live hotel integration is not implemented. `app/HOTEL_INTEGRATION.md` is an
  architecture note.
- Tourism uses UN Tourism data via OWID. Relative price level uses World Bank
  `PA.NUS.GDP.PLI`; PLI is not a traveler budget or hotel/flight price.
- Data-refresh workflow code is ready. Automatic PR creation was last reported
  to require the external GitHub setting allowing Actions to create and approve
  pull requests; re-check before relying on that report.

## Cancelled/out-of-scope features

Do not resurrect without an explicit user decision:

- numeric accommodation cost without legitimate live provider data;
- numeric traveler budget / fabricated SAR-per-day;
- cultural compatibility ranking.

## Roadmap gate and immediate backlog

Phase 17 has not started. Current order:

1. Obtain user acceptance for the production branching questionnaire,
   worldwide results, factual overviews, and card/hero images.
2. Decide whether the factual overview is sufficient or whether sourced rich
   editorial descriptions, cities, strengths, and weaknesses are required for
   the remaining 164 countries.
3. Reassess the roadmap with the user before Phase 17.

## Handoff rule

Update this file after a material state change: phase status, production bug,
architecture decision, provider configuration, country/image coverage,
deployment verification, user acceptance, or cancelled/reopened scope. Keep
current truth only; do not turn it into a changelog.
